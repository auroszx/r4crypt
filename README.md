# r4crypt

This program creates `_DS_MENU.DAT` files.

[chishm](http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/) is the original author.

To decrypt just run:

`r4crypt -d _DS_MENU.DAT out.DAT`

To encrypt just run:

`r4crypt -e out.DAT _DS_MENU.DAT`

And that's it. You can also encrypt an .NDS file to a .DAT file.
This will allow you to run the .NDS as a firmware.
